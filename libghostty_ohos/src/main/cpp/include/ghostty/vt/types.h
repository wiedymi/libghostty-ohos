 * Initialize a sized struct to zero and set its size field.

 * Sized structs use a `size` field as the first member for ABI

 * size field to `sizeof(type)`, which allows the library to detect
 * which version of the struct the caller was compiled against.
 *
 * @param type The struct type to initialize
 * @return A zero-initialized struct with the size field set
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * GhosttyFormatterTerminalOptions opts = GHOSTTY_INIT_SIZED(GhosttyFormatterTerminalOptions);
 * opts.emit = GHOSTTY_FORMATTER_FORMAT_PLAIN;
 * opts.trim = true;
 * @endcode
